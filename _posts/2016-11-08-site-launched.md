Today marks the day of the launch of my new site, which once it is finished will incooperate information about me.

<h1>Blogging with GitHub and Jekyll </h1>

<h2>Wordpress</h2>
 is a powerful tool  differentiation between wordpress.org and .com
o wordpress.com
 pros: easy to use, straightforward interface, documentation  cons: freemium, you have to pay for decent designs, many restrictions, even when paid not very flexible
o wordpress.org
 pros: extreme customizability, lots to learn, if you learned it you can add it to your portfolio, large community, detailed documentation  cons: learning curve, time, finding a host -> usually paid 
o wordpress in general
 pros: established name, common platform, comment system, gravatar cons: it is literally everywhere.

<h2>What I want to achieve:<\h2>
 Uni: Make tutors happy for Interior + Environmental Design, follow change by design
brief  Portfolio: Slowly build up portfolio for web presence after graduation

<h2>Wait but what is there beyond academic and professional success? </h2>
Learn, Have fun, Make it look nice, -because I am a designer and artist-, Document progress –where am I and where am I going?-, honest voice
Theres a lot of things I can do and I can show that off, but there is many things I am bad at and I will put it out there. 
And then show that I can get better. Extract best work onto a separate thing afterwards. 

<h2>What is GitHub? What is Jekyll?</h2>
Pros: Already had programming experience. Strong learning curve. Both Jekyll and GitHub are designed to be used by professionals and beginners alike. Cons: Learn new skill, need to establish it, project due soon.
“Git, GitHub, and GitHub Pages are all very closely related. Imagine Git as the workflow to get things done and GitHub and GitHub Pages as places to store the work you finish. Projects that use Git are stored publicly in GitHub and GitHub Pages, so in a very generalized way, Git is what you do locally on your own computer and GitHub is the place where all this gets stored publicly on a server.”
